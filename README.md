# Olympus Framework

The Olympus Framework is the best place to start for your next SaaS business
or sideproject. Olympus is an application built to be quickly spun into any
common SaaS business model. 


### Background & Problem

Launching a SaaS application as a business is really hard. The unfortunate 
reality is there is a mountain of work to do before you can even begin working
on your application. Entrepreneurs and developers, the cost conscious bunch
they are, try to minimize as much of this work around areas such as billing,
security and analytic systems. 

The result has been not great. The applicaiton is shipped barely 
functional, database leaks and security holes are there for anyone that wants
to look, and the price spent is way more than budgeted. 

And so arrives Olympus. Olympus is the culmination of over a decade working 
with poorly built production Rails applications. I found myself rewriting
the same systems over and over again at a variety of different companies and
businesses. I learned that the biggest enemy to a developer is thinking that
their application is special. The reality is that 80% of an application is 
easy sharable (okay back of napkin guesstimate there). 

Olympus is that 80%. From day one, it lets you hit the ground running jumping
into the fun 20% that is custom to you. Everything else to make your SaaS app
function is provided. Don't need certain bits of functionality? Easily delete
it. The modular nature makes it easy to remove the parts that you may not need.

### What kind of developer is this for?

Olympus is meant to be the most powerful toolset for launching your SaaS
business or sideproject, but not necessarily the easiest. While 
ease of use is a top concern, it's important to still have some 
general knowledge of building applications and architecture. 
Olympus additions are written in plain and simple Ruby. We
don't use any DSL and try not to abstract away every bit of functionality. If
you're just starting out as a beginner, there may be other places to get a bit
better start and then jump back here when you can fairly easily read and 
navigate a code base. 

### Getting started

Olympus has a comprehensive getting started guide here: (TODO: Add link). 
Once your up and running make sure to read the framework guide here: (TODO: Add link)
The framework guide has documentation around the individual modules and areas
of Olympus as well as code references on how to implement the common bits that
you will need to build your app. Since the documentation lives directly in the
repo, it's a breeze to copy code from the docs right into the views and 
controllers you are using.
